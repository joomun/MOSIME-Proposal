A proposal for The MOSIME (AI-Driven Urban Mobility) project aims to address urban transportation challenges by using generative AI. 
The problem analysis highlights issues like traffic congestion, road safety, inefficient traffic management, and the lack of driver safety features. 
The proposed solution consists of three phases:
- Phase 1: Data Collection and Analysis
- Phase 2: Model Development and Testing
- Phase 3: Implementation and Deployment
